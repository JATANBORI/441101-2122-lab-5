# Practice Lab 5 â€“ Loops and Files

In this lab, we will introduce the break and continue keywords for changing the behaviour of loops. The break keyword enables loops to exit early. The continue keyword allows a loop to continue by skipping part of the loop. We will also see how to use accumulators. They are similar to counters, but we add a variable instead of a constant to another variable. Finally, we will see how to use nested loops, which have outer and inner loops.
